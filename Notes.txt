Analyse and discuss the common vulnerability of the similar system. Highlight only 3 
vulnerabilities of the system.


For Confidentiality and Integrety

1. SQL Injection:
If user inputs are not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker might inject malicious SQL code into the authentication query. This could lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
Potential Impact:
Unauthorized access to user accounts.
Disclosure of sensitive information.
Manipulation or deletion of user data.

Mitigation
We use parameterized queries with mongoose and apply validation while taking any input from the user.


2. Insecure Session Management:

If the session management mechanism is not secure, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities such as session fixation or session hijacking to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

Potential Impact:
Unauthorized access to user accounts.
Session impersonation.
Theft of sensitive session data.
Mitigation: Use secure session management practices, such as generating a unique session ID, using secure session storage, and implementing session timeouts. Additionally, ensure that session data is protected against tampering.

Solution
we use JWT mechanism for authentication and authorization to mitigate the risk of session Hijacking.

3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Without proper input validation and output encoding, user-supplied data could be rendered as part of the web page, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. These scripts can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers.

Potential Impact:
Theft of session cookies.
Defacement of web pages.
Performing actions on behalf of authenticated users without their consent.
Mitigation: Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
using helmetJs, Implement Content Security Policy headers to restrict the sources from which various types of content can be loaded, thereby mitigating the risk of XSS


For the High Availabilty, we use mongo DB, it is very easy in monogDB to manage distributed clusters and scale it.
